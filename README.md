vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$
```
-The second one execute this program based in sentences saved in a file like this

```sh
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$ cat test_file
/bin/ls
ls
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$ cat test_file | ./hsh
file1 file2 file3.c file4.js
file1 file2 file3.c file 4.js
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$
```

# Exit program
